Before attempting a manual installation of GeoAlarm, 
you must first allow your phone to install from “Unknown Sources” (i.e. non-Market apps).

To do this, navigate to Menu -> Settings -> Applications and check the box marked “Unknown Sources“.

Step 1: Install File Manager

Android does not natively come with any method of browsing the data on your SD card, 
so you will need to install a file manager from a market. We recommend ASTRO File Manager.

Step 2: Copy .apk file to SD card

Once you have ASTRO File Manager installed, connect your Android device to your PC using your USB cable.
Mount the SD card and copy over the .apk file you would like to install.

On your Android device, navigate to the .apk file using ASTRO File Manager and select it.

This will open a dialog box allowing you to install the app. Select “Open App Manager“.

On the next two pages, select “Install” and “Install” again to install the .apk.

Your new app is now installed.
